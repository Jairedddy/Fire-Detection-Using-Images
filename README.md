# Fire-Detection-Using-Images
Google Collab code to identify fire in a dataset of images using 2 different models.

Dataset of images link: https://github.com/DeepQuestAI/Fire-Smoke-Dataset/releases/download/v1/FIRE-SMOKE-DATASET.zip

3 categories of images: Fire, Normal and Smoke.

Copy the code from the files into google collab and run all sections. The last step asks to upload a photo. Upload any photo from the huge dataset and the result will be shown.

Results of the 2 models, namely Inception V3 and AlexNet CNN are compared.
